We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 






## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-sftp/releases).


### Simple Example
### Public
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "sftp" {
      source         = "clouddrove/sftp/aws"
      version        = "1.3.1"      
      name           = "sftp"
      environment    = "test"
      label_order    = ["environment", "name"]
      enable_sftp    = true
      s3_bucket_name = module.s3_bucket.id
      endpoint_type  = "PUBLIC"
      workflow_details = {
        on_upload = {
          execution_role = "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/test-sftp-transfer-role"
          workflow_id    = "w-12345XXXX6da"
        }
      }
    }
```

### VPC
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
    module "sftp" {
      source                 = "clouddrove/sftp/aws"
      name                   = "sftp"
      environment            = "test"
      label_order            = ["environment", "name"]
      eip_enabled            = false
      s3_bucket_name         = module.s3_bucket.id
      sftp_users             = var.sftp_users
      subnet_ids             = module.subnets.private_subnet_id
      vpc_id                 = module.vpc.vpc_id
      restricted_home        = true
      vpc_security_group_ids = [module.security_group_sftp.security_group_id]
      workflow_details = {
        on_upload = {
          execution_role = "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:role/test-sftp-transfer-role"
          workflow_id    = "w-12345XXXX6da"
        }
      }
    }
```





## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| address\_allocation\_ids | A list of address allocation IDs that are required to attach an Elastic IP address to your SFTP server's endpoint. This property can only be used when endpoint\_type is set to VPC. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | <pre>[<br>  "transfer"<br>]</pre> | no |
| domain | Where your files are stored. S3 or EFS | `string` | `"S3"` | no |
| domain\_name | Domain to use when connecting to the SFTP endpoint | `string` | `""` | no |
| eip\_enabled | Whether to provision and attach an Elastic IP to be used as the SFTP endpoint. An EIP will be provisioned per subnet. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| enable\_sftp | Set to false to prevent the module from creating any resources. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| enable\_workflow | n/a | `bool` | `false` | no |

| force\_destroy | Forces the AWS Transfer Server to be destroyed | `bool` | `false` | no |
| identity\_provider\_type | The mode of authentication enabled for this service. The default value is SERVICE\_MANAGED, which allows you to store and access SFTP user credentials within the service. API\_GATEWAY. | `string` | `"SERVICE_MANAGED"` | no |

| transfer\_server\_endpoint | The endpoint of the Transfer Server (e.g. s-12345678.server.transfer.REGION.amazonaws.com). |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
